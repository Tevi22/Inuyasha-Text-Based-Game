# InuYasha: Quest of The Shikon Jewel

#### Overview
The nefarious demon Naraku has seized control of Mt. Hakurai, driven by the malevolent ambition to amass all four shards of the Shikon Jewel. His sinister plan aims to transform all humans into demons. As the formidable half-demon Inuyasha, you must embark on a perilous quest to retrieve the scattered Shikon jewel pieces located in The Forest of InuYasha, Toga’s Tomb, Temple of Kannon, and Mushin’s Temple.

#### Mission
To effectively confront the malevolent Naraku, you must acquire two crucial artifacts. The first is Inuyasha's demon-slaying sword, Tenseiga, hidden within the confines of Totosai Blacksmith Hut. This powerful weapon is indispensable in your mission to defeat the evil demon. Additionally, you must seek out Inuyasha's demon fire robe, safeguarded in the Outskirt Lands. This enchanted attire serves as a protective barrier against Naraku's potent evil miasma, ensuring your safety as you face the formidable adversary.
